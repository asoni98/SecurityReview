Analyze the codebase at ${codebasePath} with a focus on SERVICE-LEVEL architecture, not individual files or functions.

**PRIMARY GOAL**: Identify distinct services and map how they communicate with each other.

1. **Service Identification** (focus on architectural boundaries):
   - List all deployable services/components (look for separate directories, docker-compose services, separate package.json files, etc.)
   - For each service, identify:
     * Service name and purpose
     * Technology stack (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
     * Entry point (main.ts, app.py, index.js, etc.)
     * Directory/path in monorepo

2. **Service Interfaces** (what each service exposes):
   - HTTP/REST APIs: List endpoint patterns (e.g., /api/users/*, /api/orders/*) rather than individual routes
   - GraphQL: Schema files and main query/mutation groups
   - gRPC: Service definitions from .proto files
   - Message Queue Topics: What topics/queues does this service publish to or consume from?
   - Databases: What databases does this service own/access?

3. **Inter-Service Communication Patterns**:
   - Service A calls Service B: What is the communication protocol? (HTTP, gRPC, message queue)
   - Map service dependencies: Which services depend on which other services?
   - Identify service discovery mechanisms (hardcoded URLs, env vars, service mesh, DNS)
   - Note async vs synchronous communication patterns

4. **Authentication/Authorization Architecture** (service-level, not function-level):
   - How does each service authenticate incoming requests? (JWT, API keys, mTLS, IAM roles)
   - How do services authenticate TO each other? (service accounts, API keys, IAM roles)
   - Which services enforce authorization and how? (middleware, gateway, per-service)
   - Identity providers or auth services

5. **User Input Entry Points** (service-level):
   - Which services accept direct user input (web requests, file uploads, webhooks)?
   - Which services only process data from other internal services?
   - What validation/sanitization patterns exist at service boundaries?

**IMPORTANT**:
- Focus on SERVICE boundaries and SERVICE-to-SERVICE communication
- Do NOT trace individual function calls within a service
- Provide service-level architecture, not implementation details
- Include directory paths for services, but avoid detailed file-by-file analysis
- Summarize patterns rather than listing every file

Analyze the Infrastructure as Code at ${iacPath} and provide:

1. **IaC Tool & Structure**:
   - Identify the IaC tool(s) used (Terraform, CDK, Pulumi, CloudFormation, etc.)
   - List main configuration files and modules

2. **Compute Resources**:
   - EC2 instances, ECS/EKS clusters, Lambda functions
   - Auto-scaling groups, instance types
   - Container definitions and task definitions

3. **Network Architecture**:
   - VPCs, subnets (public/private), route tables
   - Internet gateways, NAT gateways
   - Load balancers (ALB, NLB, API Gateway)
   - DNS configuration (Route53, etc.)

4. **Security Configuration**:
   - Security groups, NACLs
   - IAM roles, policies, and permissions
   - Service accounts, assume role policies
   - WAF rules, rate limiting

5. **Service Exposure**:
   - Which services have public IPs or load balancers
   - Ingress/egress rules for each service
   - Port configurations

6. **Data Resources**:
   - RDS databases, DynamoDB tables
   - S3 buckets, ElastiCache, etc.
   - Access policies and encryption

7. **Service Discovery & Communication**:
   - Service mesh configuration (Istio, Linkerd, etc.)
   - Internal DNS, service discovery
   - API gateway configurations

Provide detailed information with file paths and line numbers.
Include actual configuration snippets for critical security settings.
