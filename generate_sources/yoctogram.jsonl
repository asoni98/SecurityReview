It takes no direct body/param input; it depends on deps.get_current_user to retrieve the authenticated user, which likely inspects headers/cookies and may query the DB. The handler itself simply returns the user object via a response model. Authentication is required by virtue of the dependency. Given the internal-only deployment and that this is an authenticated, simple read returning the current user, the triage priority is Low. The next reviewer should focus on the dependency deps.get_current_user (auth enforcement, token/session validation, DB access) and the contents of UserDetail to avoid sensitive data leakage."}
