  "summary": "17 real user input handlers were identified (0 false positives). 10 handlers are high priority (1 critical, 9 high) due to unauthenticated sensitive operations, cross-user data exposure, and content-manipulation risks. The single critical item is unauthenticated account registration with indications of potential mass-assignment and business logic gaps. High-risk items cluster around authentication, feed exposure, media retrieval, and social interactions (comments/likes), with themes of IDOR, authorization bypass, stored/reflected XSS, and weak anti-abuse controls.\n\nImmediate review should tackle auth_register and auth_login first, then unauthenticated read endpoints (feed_latest, feed_by_user, images_retrieve, images_get_likes), followed by authenticated media/social mutation endpoints (images_generate_upload_link; images_comment create/update/delete). Reviewers should validate strict allow-listing for model binding, object-level authorization on every data fetch/mutation, robust output encoding for user-generated content, and proper rate limiting/pagination to limit scraping and brute-force risk.",

    "Validate output encoding/sanitization for user content (comments/filenames), and ensure tokens/cookies have secure flags and short lifetimes.",
    "Exercise endpoints with both authenticated and unauthenticated clients, including blocked/private cases, to probe IDOR and authorization bypass."
